# Changing a navigation's style on scroll

These files are to compliment my video tutorial which you [you can find here](https://youtu.be/RxnV9Xcw914).

## How to use these files
Both the start and end version use Gulp for the live reloading and compiling Sass to CSS. To use the build, you need npm and gulp installed first.

With those, in your command line, simply type "gulp watch" to get started.
